# string-search-algorithms
The project implements the brute force and KMP string search algorithms to enable searching in the text editor.
The search method in Search class takes two arguments: the text to search through and the string to search for. The method returns an integer as follows:
* The starting index of the first match in the text if one exists.
* -1 if no match exists.

The Programme implements two versions of this method, one using brute force search and one using the KMP search algorithm.

The project also implements the Huffman coding and decoding algorithm. The encode method returns a binary string, i.e. a string containing only 1 's and 0 's. Similarly, decode takes a binary string as its argument. User can run the Huffman encoding by selecting compression in the GUI window and then can select an input file and output file and then can run the the algorithm by clicking on run.
